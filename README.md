## What's Cloudberry Database

Cloudberry Database (`CBDB` or `CloudberryDB` for short) is created by a bunch
of original Greenplum Database developers and ASF committers. We aim to bring
modern computing capabilities to the traditional distributed MPP database to
support Analytics and AI/ML workloads in one platform.

As a derivative of Greenplum Database 7, Cloudberry Database is compatible
with Greenplum Database, but it's shipped with a newer PostgreSQL 14.4 kernel
(scheduled kernel upgrade yearly) and a bunch of features Greenplum Database
lacks or does not support. View the [Cloudberry Database vs Greenplum
Database](https://cloudberrydb.org/docs/cbdb-vs-gp-features) doc for details.
